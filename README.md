### **Understanding Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) 

**What is Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)?**  
Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) tells us how much the quantity of a product people buy changes when the price of that product changes. It’s like figuring out if people will still buy something when it becomes more expensive or if they will buy more when it gets cheaper.

---

### **How is it Calculated?**  
We use this simple formula:  
**PED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) ÷ (% Change in Price)**

For example:
- If the price of a chocolate bar increases by 10% and people buy 20% less, the PED = -20 ÷ 10 = -2.  
  This means the demand is **elastic**, and people are sensitive to price changes.

### **Why is PED Useful?**
Businesses use PED to decide how to price their products:
1. **If PED > 1 (Elastic Demand):**  
   Small price drops can attract more customers and increase sales.  
   Example: A shop discounts soda, and many people buy more.  
   
2. **If PED < 1 (Inelastic Demand):**  
   Raising prices doesn’t reduce sales much, so the business can earn more money.  
   Example: Milk prices go up slightly, but people still buy it because it’s a necessity.

### **Using Data to Analyze PED**
To find PED, businesses collect data like product prices and sales. With this data, we can see how changes in price affect how much people buy.

### **Steps to Analyze PED Using Python**
1. **Import the Data:**  
   Load the data with details like price, quantity sold, and sales.  

   Example of data:  
   | Price | Quantity Sold | Sales Amount |  
   |-------|---------------|--------------|  
   | ₹100  | 500           | ₹50,000      |  
   | ₹120  | 450           | ₹54,000      |  

2. **Calculate Percentage Changes:**  
   - How much the price and quantity change over time.  
   - Example: If price increases by 20%, how much does the quantity decrease?  

3. **Find PED for Each Product:**  
   Divide the percentage change in quantity by the percentage change in price.  

4. **Group Products by Elasticity:**  
   - **Highly Elastic:** People are very sensitive to price changes.  
   - **Inelastic:** People buy even if the price changes.  
   - **Unitary Elastic:** Price changes and sales change equally.  

---

### **Visualizing the Data**
- **Scatter Plot:** A graph showing how price changes (x-axis) relate to quantity changes (y-axis).  
   Example:  
   - Points close to the middle mean people don’t change their buying habits much (inelastic).  
   - Points far from the middle mean people react strongly to price changes (elastic).  

---

### **How to Use PED in Pricing Decisions**
1. **Negative Elasticity:** Lower prices to sell more.  
   Example: Discount sales on electronics to boost purchases.  

2. **Unitary Elastic:** Maintain prices and focus on product quality.  

3. **Highly Elastic:** Offer promotions to take advantage of customer sensitivity.  

4. **Zero Elasticity:** Price doesn’t matter much, so focus on making the product better.  

---

### **Summary**
Price Elasticity of Demand helps businesses understand how their customers react to price changes. By calculating PED, businesses can make smarter decisions about pricing, sales, and promotions. It’s like a guide to help them balance price and sales to maximize profits.  

Using tools like Python and data visualization makes it easier to analyze PED and create better strategies!
